(Hint: If you love these authors you will love Richard’s books). He started writing at 16 but the dream faded until a few years ago when he started writing again. During his twenties he studied business studies and accountancy. During this time he also studied Shaolin and Wing Chun Kung Fu and even starting a school with a friend. He has worked as an accountant, Software developer in the City of London for banks and insurance companies, and is now an author.
